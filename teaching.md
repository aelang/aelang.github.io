#### Writings on teaching



I’ve written about using online learning journals to help students in English literature get to grips with literary theory for the UK Higher Education Academy’s English Subject Centre.



I’ve used techniques from corpus linguistics to analyse online student discussions from a course on Canadian fiction, in order to work out how to get students to engage with each other rather than simply agreeing with each other’s points.



I ran a research project at Queen Mary University of London which used a social network site to develop intercultural awareness in language students going abroad, and presented the results at Digital Humanities 2010. A full report on the project was published in a special issue of Arts and Humanities in Higher Education on Digital Futures.
