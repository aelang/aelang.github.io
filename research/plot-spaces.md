#### Plot-spaces: 3D-fabricated objects to think with



<img style="float:right;border:10px solid white" src="/IDwell_02Med.jpg"> “you build something so that you can think with that thing” – Sara Hendren, ["Now It Springs Up!" Undefended / Undefeated, 21 May 2025] (https://sarahendren.substack.com/p/now-it-springs-up).


Hendren's talking specifically about prototyping as a way of thinking, but her point applies to things beyond prototypes.


Since summer 2024 I have been using Edinburgh's two makerlabs - the uCreate Studio in the UoE library and the EFI Makerspace - for experiments I call plot-spaces: things which take a quality in a literary text which changes over time -- eg. the scale of entities referred to in a poem -- and gives it material form via 3D printing. This has been, from start to finish, delightful: building things while everything is burning down both metaphorically and physically turns out to be extremely restorative. Also, maker labs are wonderful spaces that somehow escape the logics driving the rest of the university, and just being one while the printers hum and the machines whirr and people whittle things or set the embroidery machine going or tend to the resin printer is restful.
