#### About me

<img style="float:right;border:10px solid white" src="/circlecrop.jpg">Hello, I'm Anouk Lang, a [Senior Lecturer in Digital Humanities](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/anouk-lang) at the University of Edinburgh, where I teach digital humanities, postcolonial studies, and twentieth and twenty-first century literature. My PhD is in literature, which is my first love, but since completing it I've found my work increasingly intersecting with other disciplines such as cultural sociology, geography and network analysis. These days I am trying to learn things like R, ArcGIS, regex and the principles of good data visualisation in order to find out what kind of new analytical vistas these things can offer humanities scholars.

I grew up in Australia and originally started out as a musician, doing a B.Mus at the University of Sydney where I was fortunate to study piano with Stephanie McCallum and composition with Anne Boyd. Following this I did a Bachelor of Arts with honours in English at Sydney and came to the UK to do a PhD at Cambridge on modernism and postcolonial literature. After my PhD I did a postdoc in the School of English, Drama and American and Canadian Studies at the University of Birmingham, where I worked on the transnational AHRC project Beyond the Book. I'm a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy in the UK, a member of the Peer Review College of the AHRC, and have been PI on grants from the AHRC, the British Academy and the Carnegie Trust.
