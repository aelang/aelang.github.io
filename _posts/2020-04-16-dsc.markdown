This project started life in late 2019 as a bit of fun by a handful of feminist scholars - Quinn Dombrowski, Katia Bowers, Roopika Risam, Maria Cecire, me, and a little later Lee Skallerup Bessette - whose overlapping backgrounds in library science, modern languages, English literature, digital humanities and children's literature turned out to be surprisingly handy when it came to turning a simultaneously critical and nostalgic lens onto a young adult fiction series we had all read and felt ourselves to be shaped by as girls and teenagers in the 1980s and 1990s: Ann M. Martin's *The Baby-Sitters Club*. Quinn, our inexhaustible and endlessly creative Kristy, describes how the project got started on [the chapter 2 section](https://datasittersclub.github.io/site/chapter-2/) of our website.

Since then, the Data-Sitters Club has gathered considerable momentum, winning places in two categories in the [2019 DH Awards] (http://dhawards.org/dhawards2019/results/), being featured in [Inside Higher Ed](https://insidehighered.com/news/2020/04/15/we-need-fun-more-ever-digital-humanities-meets-baby-sitters-club-books), and getting a lot of love on Twitter for [Quinn's growing gallery of covid-19 public service announcements which pastiche BSC book covers](https://datasittersclub.github.io/site/covid19/). At this point (April 2020), we have seven books in total: 4 books in the regular series (of which #4, *AntConc Saves the Day*, is my contribution) and 3 books in the Multilingual Mysteries series which investigates translations of the books. It's a project I'm very happy to be part of: it's an example of feminist pedagogy in action, it embodies the digital humanities ethos of openness and accessibility, it's a reminder of the importance of taking popular culture seriously, and we see it bringing joy on a regular basis to those who discover it on Twitter, at a time when joy is in short supply. I am drafting my next DSC book, on some compelling weird BSC-esque prose generated by a neural network, so that should be out over the next little while: stay tuned to [#DataSittersClub](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23DataSittersClub&src=typed_query) for more.
