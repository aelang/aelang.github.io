#### Research projects

### [Word embedding models: A very quick introduction](/word-embeddings)
A brief introduction to word embedding models, designed for literary researchers and those in related fields.

### [Patrick Twite](https://twitter.com/patricktwite)
A bot which tweets out Markov chain-generated chunks of prose redolent of the Australian novelist Patrick White. No funder, just for fun :)


#### Funded projects

### [Working from Scraps](http://digitaldecoupage.llc.ed.ac.uk)
This project, conceptualised by [Bridget Moynihan](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/bridget-moynihan) (Edinburgh) as part of her PhD research and built by her and [Jonathan Armoza](https://github.com/jarmoza/) (NYU), produced a digital prototype based on selections from the Edwin Morgan Scrapbooks. Employing information visualisation principles to convey the thematic and semantic richness of the scrapbooks while avoiding breaching copyright, the project aimed to bring out as many of the elements of the Morgan scrapbooks as possible: their networked qualities, the manifold resonances between images and scraps of texts, the structure of individual pages and the semantic relationships and thematic preoccupations visible across the scrapbooks as a whole. Funder: [The Carnegie Trust](https://www.carnegie-trust.org/).

### [Beyond the Black Box](http://blackbox.llc.ed.ac.uk)
A collection of digital humanities learning resources designed for researchers in literary studies and related fields, and intended to foster statistical, algorithmic and quantitative literacy. These workshops were originally delivered by their authors at a series of advanced digital humanities workshops at the University of Edinburgh in 2017. Funder: [The British Academy](http://www.britac.ac.uk/).
