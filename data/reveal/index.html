<h4>Fertility myths</h4>
<div align="left">
<p>  April is the cruellest month, breeding
<p>Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing 
<p>Memory and desire, stirring 
<p>Dull roots with spring rain. 
<p>Winter kept us warm, covering 
<p>Earth in forgetful snow, feeding 
<p>A little life with dried tubers. 
</div>

<div align="left">
<p class="small">Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee 
<p class="small">With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade, 
<p class="small">And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten, 
<p class="small">And drank coffee, and talked for an hour. 
<p class="small">Bin gar keine Russin, stamm' aus Litauen, echt deutsch. 
<p class="small">And when we were children, staying at the arch-duke's, 
<p class="small">My cousin's, he took me out on a sled, 
<p class="small">And I was frightened. He said, Marie, 
<p class="small">Marie, hold on tight. And down we went. 
<p class="small">In the mountains, there you feel free. 
<p class="small">I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.

<p>What are the roots that clutch, what branches grow
<p>Out of this stony rubbish? Son of man,
<p>You cannot say, or guess, for you know only
<p>A heap of broken images, where the sun beats,
<p>And the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief,
<p>And the dry stone no sound of water.

<p>Above the antique mantel was displayed 
<p>As though a window gave upon the sylvan scene 
<p>The change of Philomel, by the barbarous king 
<p>So rudely forced; yet there the nightingale 
<p>Filled all the desert with inviolable voice 
<p>And still she cried, and still the world pursues, 
<p>"Jug Jug" to dirty ears.

<p class="small">Turn upward from the desk, when the human engine waits
<p class="small">Like a taxi throbbing waiting, 
<p class="small">I Tiresias, though blind, throbbing between two lives, 
<p class="small">Old man with wrinkled female breasts, can see 
<p class="small">At the violet hour, the evening hour that strives 
<p class="small">Homeward, and brings the sailor home from sea, 
<p class="small">The typist home at teatime, clears her breakfast, lights

<p class="small">Endeavours to engage her in caresses 
<p class="small">Which still are unreproved, if undesired. 
<p class="small">Flushed and decided, he assaults at once; 
<p class="small">Exploring hands encounter no defence; 
<p class="small">His vanity requires no response, 
<p class="small">And makes a welcome of indifference.

<p>... Can poetry's traditional resources, rhythm and rhyme, suffice for what the modern world can throw in its path: a typist, her room, a scene of urban squalor?

<p class="small">I can't help it, she said, pulling a long face, 
<p class="small">It's them pills I took, to bring it off, she said. 
<p class="small">(She's had five already, and nearly died of young George.) 
<p class="small">The chemist said it would be all right, but I've never been the same. ...

<h4>Intertextual and mythic references</h4>
<div align="left">
<p>In using the myth, in manipulating a continuous parallel between contemporaneity and antiquity, Mr. Joyce is pursuing a method which ... [is] a way of controlling, of ordering, of giving a shape and a significance to the immense panorama of futility and anarchy which is contemporary history ... Instead of narrative method, we may now use the mythical method. It is, I seriously believe, a step toward making the modern world possible for art ...
